PM] Tareni: From accommodating social obligations to engaging in silly fights, the first year of marriage truly puts your relationship to test, feels Divya Nair.\\n\\nLessons I learned from my first year of marriageTime flies so fast.\\n\\n\\nIt feels like yesterday when I wrote my first wedding column on Rediff.com.\\n\\nFrom then on, it\\'s been one hell of a ride for us.\\n\\nOn January 24, we celebrated our first wedding anniversary -- away from each other.\\n\\nHe was working on an important project in Norway while I was in Mumbai.\\n\\nAnd that was one of those few instances when I felt I was better off alone than married.\\n\\nAs we complete a year of marriage, I\\'d like to share with you some of the important lessons my husband and I learned as a couple.\\n\\nPlans will fail, there will be disappointments\\n\\nGone are the times when the wife cooked for the husband and waited by the door for him to arrive so they could have dinner together.\\n\\nForget having dinner together, on Fridays, my husband sometimes arrived home earlier from Pune, after travelling three long hours, but I would still be stuck at work in Mumbai.\\n\\nAnd the one weekend when I made an exquisite three course meal, my husband was stuck in road traffic and got delayed by five hours.\\n\\nHis phone was switched off and I was growing impatient.\\n\\nWhen he finally landed home and told me his phone\\'s battery had died because he had been watching a movie on it, I wanted to tear his hair out.\\n\\nI soon realised there was no point fussing over lost time.\\n\\nI reheated the food and sat down with him to eat.\\n\\nI do not get to meet my parents often.\\n\\nWhen one of my friends told me that after marriage she could not meet her parents who lived just an apartment away, I thought she was exaggerating.\\n\\nAlthough I stay only 30 kilometres away from my mom\\'s place, I do not get to visit her as much as I promised to.\\n\\nIn fact, most of our conversations take place over the phone.\\n\\nI sometimes miss the good old days when after a tiring day at work, I could rush home and sleep like there\\'s no tomorrow.\\n\\nThere will be social obligations.\\n\\nUntil I got married, if I did not want to attend a family event I could always request my parents to excuse me.\\n\\nMuch as I want to, I cannot do the same with my in-laws -- there is constant pressure to attend at least one family event every week or month.\\n\\nAnd since it\\u2019s your first year of marriage, if you do not turn up for a social event, people will begin to judge you as being \\'arrogant\\', \\'selfish\\' etc.\\n\\nWhether you like it or not, you\\u2019ll have to attend funerals, marriages, birthdays and baby showers hosted by people you\\'ve hardly met.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll disappoint some of your friends.\\n\\nAll those promises I made to my friends about meeting them at least once a month post marriage hardly came true.\\n\\nIf you fail to attend two or more events hosted by your close friends, you\\'ll be called a spoil sport.\\n\\nIn the last one year, I can count on my fingers the number of friends I have met.\\n\\nAt the same time, I have lost count of the number of meeting and reunion requests I have turned down.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t expect your friends to understand why in the first year of marriage attending a family event is more important than their mehndi or baby shower.\\n\\nAs long as your friends tease you for the absence it is fine, but there will be times when a friend refuses to talk to you because you cancelled their plans more than once.\\n\\nYou cannot avoid the \\u2018baby\\u2019 question.\\n\\nAll those aunties and relatives who once upon a time wanted to know when you were getting married now want to know when you\\u2019re planning a baby.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t really matter that some of these concerned aunties did not attend your wedding.\\n\\nWithin a few months of being married, be prepared for unwarranted advice like \\'Do not delay your pregnancy\\', \\'At least start planning your first child else it will be too late\\u2026\\'\\n\\nWhenever I see these aunties, I wish I could disappear in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nMarriage is not all about love and sex.\\n\\nWithin a few months of our marriage, we realised that sex is just a part of our relationship.\\n\\nSometimes, it\\'s all about treating each other as friends and sharing responsibilities.\\n\\nOther times, it is about two different people trying too hard to find common ground.\\n\\nIn the last one year, we have fought, made sacrifices, blamed each other and gone to bed without talking to each other for days together.\\n\\nSometimes, I have had to manage multiple responsibilities all by myself and wondered if I was married at all.\\n\\nHowever, with time, I have realised that the true test of marriage lies in nurturing the desire to live with the same person and rekindle your love for each other despite the limitations.\\n\\nIn a world filled with imperfections, we need to constantly remind each other that nobody and nothing is perfect, including us.\\n\\nAs we complete a year of marriage, I feel I have grown up to expect less and love more.\\r\\n[1/29/15, 10:03:13 PM] Tareni: Good article\\r\\n[1/30/15, 12:45:18 AM] Sampad Mishra: Kya dudu?!

They promised any general who retired straight away his full annual benefits plus $10,000 for every inch measured in a straight line between any two parts of the general\\'s body, with the general getting to select any pair of points he wished. \\n\\nThe first man, an Air Force general, accepted. He asked the pension man to measure from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. Six feet. He walked out with a check of $720,000. \\n\\nThe second man, an Army general, asked them to measure from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. Eight feet. He walked out with a check for $960,000. \\n\\nWhen the third general, a grizzled old Marine, was asked where to measure, he told the pension man ... \\'From the tip of my penis to the bottom of my testicles.\\' The pension man suggested that perhaps the Marine general might like to reconsider, pointing out the nice checks the previous two generals had received.

Kamasutra says : If you suck one nipple, the women herself offers the other one. And that was the origin of \"buy one get one free\"!\\n\\n2. Did you ever notice: everything on a woman\\'s upper body starts with a \"B\". Blouse, Bra, Bikini, Boobs & lower body with a \"P\" Peticoat, panties, pussy... That\\'s origin of \"BP\"!\\n\\n3. Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself. Moral: In life no one helps you once you\\'re fucked.\\n\\n4. Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.\\n\\n5. What is the difference between frustration and satisfaction?

If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:\\n\\u2022 The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.\\n\\u2022 The fifth would pay $1.\\n\\u2022 The sixth would pay $3.\\n\\u2022 The seventh would pay $7.\\n\\u2022 The eighth would pay $12.\\n\\u2022 The ninth would pay $18.\\n\\u2022 The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.\\nSo, that\\'s what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw\\nthem a curve. \\'..since you are all such good customers\\', he said, \\'I am going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.Drinks for the ten now cost just $80\\'.\\nThe group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what\\nabout the other six men - the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his \\'fair share?\\' \\nThey realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody\\'s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.\\nSo, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man\\'s bill by roughly the proportionate amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay. And thus,\\n\\u2022 The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).\\n\\u2022 The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).\\n\\u2022 The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).\\n\\u2022 The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25%savings).\\n\\u2022 The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).\\n\\u2022 The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).\\nEach of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.\\n\\'I only got a dollar out of the $20,\\' declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,\\' but he got $10!\\'\\n\\'Yeah, that\\'s right,\\' exclaimed the fifth man. \\'I only saved a dollar, too. It\\'s unfair that he got ten times more than I did!\\'\\n\\'That\\'s true!!\\' shouted the seventh man. \\'Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!\\'\\n\\'Wait a minute,\\' yelled the first four men in unison. \\'We didn\\'t get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!\\'\\nThe nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.\\nThe next night the tenth man didn\\'t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they\\ndiscovered something important- > They didn\\'t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!\\nAnd that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore.

But the documentary thought to show a particular Case that has shook the  nation, other cases would not have raised eyebrows, that\\'s why interview of other inmates in tihar jail are inconsequential..\\r\\n[3/5/15, 11:58:43 PM] Sampad Mishra: If media, law and government can act on priority for particular case, so is this documentary!\\r\\n[3/6/15, 1:08:50 AM] Tareni: Leslee Udwin\\'s India\\'s Daughter concludes with a lingering, blurry shot of the December 16 gangrape victim\\'s mother: aware of a camera staring back at her, struggling to keep the personal away from the public and hold back tears. As one stray tear rolls down her left cheek, Udwin\\'s frame melts into an image of pyres burning on smog-cloaked river bank. The victim\\'s mother\\'s voice rings through the image, \"The sound of her breathing stopped, the lines on the monitor started flattening.\" As she finishes talking the camera zooms in to a pyre, the black fonts of the last line stand out against the quivering flames in the background.\\n\\nIt\\'s the kind of camera technique used in movies. It was hard enough to listen to the mother recollect the final moments of her daughter, but Udwin\\'s documentary can\\'t leave it there. It must make the heavy handed and forced trick of cutting in the image of the pyre\\n\\nAnd then you start to think: what question did Udwin ask the victim\\'s mother that she narrates in great detail such a painful experience to a camera. While, \\'what were his/her last words\\' may be a standard questions many journalists clinically ask the kin of the dead, it doesn\\'t become less exploitative with repetition. Or less traumatizing for an interviewee.\\n\\nThat closing shot also reveals Udwin\\'s greatest sin: A predilection for the dramatic, to disdain nuance in favour of excess.\\n\\n\\nThe primary trajectory that the documentary follows is a reconstruction of the day\\'s events; two narratives run simultaneously, following on each other\\'s heels. The effect -- intended or not -- is exploitative.\\n\\nAsked to talk about the day the rape took place, convict Mukesh Singh says nonchalantly, \"We decided we will go to GB road. People do wrong things there,\" as the camera pans on prostitutes lined up the road. Immediately,  the documentary cuts to the victim\\'s mother talking about how the day started off for her. \"She came back home and was very happy that the exams were over...\" she says.\\n\\nAt another point, Mukesh is saying, \"Then they said, she must be dead. Throw her, throw her out.\" The documentary juxtaposes Mukesh\\'s voice for a while with a visual of the  victim\\'s mother weeping, her head in her hands.\\n\\nIndia\\'s Daughter has all the finesse of  the average Bollywood potboiler -- which may be amusing in fiction but is offensive in the retelling of heinous crime. The juxtaposition of two narratives for high drama feels very wrong, where the grief of the victim\\'s family becomes a cinematographic effect to enhance the impact of the rapist\\'s account.  It is clear what the director perhaps intended to do: to try every trick in the book to maximise the impact of the story. But this is a horror tale that needs no embroidering. To \\'jazz\\' it up is to do great disservice to an already gut-wrenching incident.\\n\\nAnd then there is the narrative arc. What purpose is served by making the perpetrator and the victim\\'s kin recollect details of that day? Not only does it feed a voyeuristic curiousity, but by also giving a disproportionate amount of time to Mukesh Singh, the documentary feels like it should be titled not India\\'s Daughter, but rather The Man Who Raped India\\'s Daughter.\\n\\nMukesh Singh gets an uninterrupted stage to say his \"piece\", as when he says, \"The juvenile put his hand inside her and something came out. I guess it was her intestines...\"\\n\\nHe adds, \"Later I asked him, what happened with the woman\\'s stuff. He said, I wrapped it in a towel and threw it.\"\\n\\nIt takes a special kind of resilience to sit and listen such vile things, and to do so without interrupting or objecting. But in this case, the consequence is that Mukesh Singh, a rapist and murderer gets to justify his crime. And all we can do is to watch powerlessly, as we do when women are raped over and again in this country. In a more traditional news interview, Udwin could have asked, \"Do you not think that is cruel and inhuman?\" It would have added a much needed counterpoint to Mukesh\\'s ghastly soliloquy.\\n\\nThe rapists\\' lawyers ML Sharma and AP Singh too get to voice their misogynistic, warped ideas with great flourish. \"A woman is like a diamond. If you leave her on the street, the dogs will come and take her,\" says Sharma.\\n\\n\"I stand by what I had said,\" declares AP Singh who had said that he will burn his sister or daughter if she ventured out in the evening like the victim.\\n\\nAs we know, these men, like many other have voiced such dangerous opinions in the past without consequences. The film doesn\\'t antagonise them either.\\n\\nThat\\'s why the documentary makes me uncomfortable. While it talks about the protests in India, and the news laws that  were passed, the film in itself fails to embody the resistance that either the victim or the people of the country put up against patriarchy and sexual violence. Pitted against the rapist and his lawyers, the victim\\'s parents look helpless and spent.\\n\\nIndia\\'s Daughter quietly listens in to what a rapist, murderer has to say. It doesn\\'t rage, it doesn\\'t even blink while doing so.  And that just feels wrong.\\r\\n[3/6/15, 1:08:54 AM] Tareni: Nice read\\r\\n[3/6/15, 1:37:46 AM] Ajay Garg: @dudu...i thought u said u r in office\\r\\n[3/6/15, 1:38:06 AM] Tareni: Yes I m\\r\\n[3/6/15, 1:38:15 AM] Tareni: Multi tasking\\r\\n[3/6/15, 6:29:14 AM] Satyajeet: Anupam what makes you think that BBC wants to demean India, what does it gain by doing so.\\r\\n[3/6/15, 6:31:49 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Ha ha ab maja ayega\\r\\n[3/6/15, 6:32:05 AM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: \\U0001f60a\\r\\n[3/7/15, 3:03:08 AM] Sampad Mishra: ABD is in such a good form that he can even play shots blindfolded!such a delight to watch him play.

Swami Vivekanand:- I can\\u2019t find free time. Life has become hectic.\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free.\\n\\n \\n\\n2. Swami Vivekanand:- Why has life become complicated now?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Stop analyzing life.. It makes it complicated. Just live it.\\n\\n \\n\\n3. Swami Vivekanand:- Why are we then constantly unhappy?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Worrying has become your habit. That\\u2019s why you are not happy.\\n\\n \\n\\n4. Swami Vivekanand:- Why do good people always suffer?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don\\u2019t suffer.\\nWith that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.\\n\\n \\n\\n5. Swami Vivekanand:- You mean to say such experience is useful?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and then the lessons. \\n\\n \\n\\n6. Swami Vivekanand:- Because of so many problems, we don\\u2019t know where we are heading\\u2026\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.\\n\\n \\n\\n7. Swami Vivekanand:- Does failure hurt more than moving in the right direction?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you.\\n\\n \\n\\n8. Swami Vivekanand:- In tough times, how do you stay motivated?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.\\n\\n \\n\\n9. Swami Vivekanand:- What surprises you about people?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- When they suffer they ask, \\u201cwhy me?\\u201d When they prosper, they never ask \\u201cWhy me?\\u201d\\n\\n \\n\\n10. Swami Vivekanand:- How can I get the best out of life?\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.\\n\\n \\n\\n11. Swami Vivekanand:- One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.\\n\\nRamkrishna Paramahansa:- There are no unanswered prayers. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.\\n--------------------------------------------\\nWish you a wonderful life ahead in 2015\\U0001f44d\\r\\n[3/11/15, 3:30:25 AM] Anupam Mishra: Ajay \"senti\" garg\\r\\n[3/11/15, 3:40:15 AM] Sampad Mishra: Uber in kolkata cost less than prepaid taxi from HOWRAH station. \\U0001f60a.

They are Ranjit Ghosh, Dipak Dolui and Rohit Kumar.\\n\\nOf the three, Dipak Dolui is a trainee employee and joined the SAIL Durgapur unit just six months back. He is reported to have been the most critically injured of the three with almost cent percent burn.\\n\\n\\nBloom Caster machine at the BOF shop of Durgapur Steel Plant where the fatal accident took place\\nWhile Ranjit Ghosh is a permanent non-executive employee of DSP in his forty\\u2019s, Rohit Pusham is a Junior Executive who was transferred to the Durgapur unit of SAIL from the Bhilai unit of SAIL in 2012. Ranjit sustained 75 percent burn injury while Rohit was almost 90 percent burnt.\\n\\nAll the three were rushed to the Mission Hospital in Durgapur; a private super specialty hospital with facilities to treat burn patients.\\n\\nWhen this article is being prepared, unconfirmed sources reports that both Dipak Dolui and Rohit Kumar have succumbed to their injuries.\\n\\n19 year old Dipak hails from Orissa and is from a very poor famil.  32 year old Rohit is survived by a 1 year old girl child.\\n\\nThe grievous incident took place at the Bloom Caster of DSP at around 12 noon today. Eyewitnesses report suggests that the ladle containing liquid steel was positioned on the turret to feed the bloom caster machine. When three employees went there to connect a cylinder so as to open the slide gate of the ladle, liquid steel from the ladle spilled on the three due to a reaction inside the ladle.\\n\\nThe incident sparked off intense reaction among workers who complained of safety violation by the management of DSP.\\n\\nOffice of the GM (steel) and that of several other executive\\u2019s offices in the SMS department were damaged by workers who virtually went insane and uncontrollable at such a massive accident.\\n\\nProduction at the BOF shop of DSP has been affected severely. When writing this report production at the bloom caster machine of the BOF shop at DSP could not be started.\\n\\nMeanwhile, trainee employees have been sitting on a \\u201cDharna\\u201d at the Training Department in demand of employment of next to keen of the deceased Dipak Dolui who hails from Orissa.\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:32:35 PM] Sampad Mishra: Accident at durgapur steel plant\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:35:04 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: There was an accident in RSP CPP also right\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:35:16 PM] Satyajeet: Yup in 2003\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:35:34 PM] Satyajeet: Two executives died in that\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:36:43 PM] Satyajeet: Third one had health issues\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:37:41 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: Not 2003\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:37:53 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: It happened this sunday\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:38:06 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: On the day of modi visit\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:38:12 PM] Satyajeet: In 2003 May someone died in RSP\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:38:31 PM] Satyajeet: Recent one I am not aware of\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:57:18 PM] Ashish Patel: Sad\\r\\n[5/11/15, 11:57:52 PM] Anupam Mishra: Really sad\\r\\n[5/12/15, 12:20:15 AM] Tareni: Tough working in steel plant\\r\\n[5/12/15, 12:22:14 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: MysteryVibe Crescendo Is A Snake-Like Buzzy Thinger For Your Down-There Parts | TechCrunch - http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/11/mysteryvibe-crescendo-is-a-snake-like-configurable-buzzy-thinger-for-your-down-there-parts/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29#.tsquk7:ROBj\\r\\n[5/12/15, 12:22:47 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Gwala ..

All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit, and ate it.\\n\\nManagement Lesson - To be sitting doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.\\n\\n\\nLesson Two\\n\\nA turkey was chatting with a bull. \"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,\" sighed the turkey, \"but I haven\\'t got the energy.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you nibble on some of my droppings?\" replied the bull. \"They\\'re packed with nutrients.\"\\n\\nThe turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.\\n\\nHe was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.\\n\\nManagement Lesson - Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won\\'t keep you there.\\n\\n\\nLesson Three\\n\\nA little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold; the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field.\\n\\nWhile he was there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realise how warm he was.\\n\\nThe dung was actually thawing him out!\\n\\nHe lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.\\n\\nA passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.\\n\\nManagement Lessons - (1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. (2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. (3) And when you\\'re in deep shit, it\\'s best to keep your mouth shut!\\n\\nThis ends your two-minute refresher management course...\\r\\n[5/13/15, 10:18:32 PM] Sampad Mishra: Old ones, but these things need to refreshed once in a while\\r\\n\\u200e[5/14/15, 6:00:52 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[5/14/15, 8:56:50 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200evideo omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[5/14/15, 11:01:32 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:01:46 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Lol\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:11:38 AM] Ashish Patel: Damm\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:11:41 AM] Ashish Patel: She looks pretty\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:11:43 AM] Ashish Patel: Abey\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:11:55 AM] Ashish Patel: Anyone has a Bluetooth earphone\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:12:08 AM] Ashish Patel: Recommended model ?\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:12:39 AM] Avinash Parhi: Tareni n sampad look so sad\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:13:29 AM] Satyajeet: Bose\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:14:01 AM] Ashish Patel: Abey\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:14:10 AM] Ashish Patel: Nevermind\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:35:54 AM] Sampad Mishra: She looks pretty, not anymore, met her in anupam engagement, abbey look is not about sadness but innocence\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:36:10 AM] Sampad Mishra: Jbl\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:48:07 AM] Ashish Patel: Not anymore\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:48:26 AM] Ashish Patel: Chi sampad\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:48:29 AM] Ashish Patel: What cheap comment\\r\\n[5/14/15, 11:49:33 AM] Sampad Mishra: How come it\\'s cheap?

As PM, he had so many things to do!!\\n\\nHe opened his case and took out the laptop, determined to put the time to some good use.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you from the software industry sir,\\u201d the man beside him was staring appreciatively at the laptop. Vivek glanced briefly and mumbled in affirmation, handling the laptop now with exaggerated care and importance as if it were an expensive car.\\n\\n\\u201cYou people have brought so much advancement to the country, Sir. Today everything is getting computerized. \\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThanks,\\u201d smiled Vivek, turning around to give the man a look. He always found it difficult to resist appreciation. The man was young and stockily built like a sportsman. He looked simple and strangely out of place in that little lap of luxury like a small town boy in a prep school. He probably was a railway sportsman making the most of his free traveling pass.\\n\\n\\u201cYou people always amaze me,\\u201d the man continued, \\u201cYou sit in an office and write something on a computer and it does so many big things outside.\\u201d\\n\\nVivek smiled deprecatingly. Naive ness demanded reasoning not anger. \\u201cIt is not as simple as that my friend. It is not just a question of writing a few lines. There is a lot of process that goes behind it.\\u201d\\n\\nFor a moment, he was tempted to explain the entire Software Development Lifecycle but restrained himself to a single statement. \\u201cIt is complex, very complex.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt has to be. No wonder you people are so highly paid,\\u201d came the reply.\\n\\nThis was not turning out as Vivek had thought. A hint of belligerence crept into his so far affable, persuasive tone. \\u201d\\n\\nEveryone just sees the money. No one sees the amount of hard work we have to put in. Indians have such a narrow concept of hard work. Just because we sit in an air-conditioned office, does not mean our brows do not sweat. You exercise the muscle; we exercise the mind and believe me that is no less taxing.\\u201d\\n\\nHe could see, he had the man where he wanted, and it was time to drive home the point.\\n\\n\\u201cLet me give you an example. Take this train. The entire railway reservation system is computerized. You can book a train ticket between any two stations from any of the hundreds of computerized booking centers across the country.\\n\\nThousands of transactions accessing a single database, at a time concurrently; data integrity, locking, data security. Do you understand the complexity in designing and coding such a system?\\u201d\\n\\nThe man was awestruck; quite like a child at a planetarium. This was something big and beyond his imagination.\\n\\n\\u201cYou design and code such things.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI used to,\\u201d Vivek paused for effect, \\u201cbut now I am the Project Manager.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh!\\u201d sighed the man, as if the storm had passed over,\\n\\n\\u201cSo your life is easy now.\\u201d\\n\\nThis was like the last straw for Vivek. He retorted, \\u201cOh come on, does life ever get easy as you go up the ladder. Responsibility only brings more work.\\n\\nDesign and coding! That is the easier part. Now I do not do it, but I am responsible for it and believe me, that is far more stressful. My job is to get the work done in time and with the highest quality.\\n\\nTo tell you about the pressures, there is the customer at one end, always changing his requirements, the user at the other, wanting something else, and your boss, always expecting you to have finished it yesterday.\\u201d\\n\\nVivek paused in his diatribe, his belligerence fading with self-realization. What he had said, was not merely the outburst of a wronged man, it was the truth. And one need not get angry while defending the truth.\\n\\n\\u201cMy friend,\\u201d he concluded triumphantly, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t know what it is to be in the Line of Fire\\u201d\\n\\nThe man sat back in his chair, his eyes closed as if in realization. When he spoke after sometime, it was with a calm certainty that surprised Vivek.\\n\\n\\u201cI know sir\\u2026. I know what it is to be in the Line of Fire\\u2026\\u2026.\\u201d\\n\\nHe was staring blankly, as if no passenger, no train existed, just a vast expanse of time.\\n\\n\\u201cThere were 30 of us when we were ordered to capture Point 4875 in the cover of the night.\\n\\nThe enemy was firing from the top.\\n\\nThere was no knowing where the next bullet was going to come from and for whom.\\n\\nIn the morning when we finally hoisted the tricolour at the top only 4 of us were alive.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are a\\u2026?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am Subedar Sushant from the 13 J&K Rifles on duty at Peak 4875 in Kargil. They tell me I have completed my term and can opt for a soft assignment.\\n\\nBut, tell me sir, can one give up duty just because it makes life easier.\\n\\nOn the dawn of that capture, one of my colleagues lay injured in the snow, open to enemy fire while we were hiding behind a bunker.\\n\\nIt was my job to go and fetch that soldier to safety. But my captain sahib refused me permission and went ahead himself.\\n\\nHe said that the first pledge he had taken as a Gentleman Cadet was to put the safety and welfare of the nation foremost followed by the safety and welfare of the men he commanded\\u2026 \\u2026.his own personal safety came last, always and every time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was killed as he shielded and brought that injured soldier into the bunker. Every morning thereafter, as we stood guard, I could see him taking all those bullets, which were actually meant for me. I know sir\\u2026.I know, what it is to be in the Line of Fire.\\u201d\\n\\nVivek looked at him in disbelief not sure of how to respond. Abruptly, he switched off the laptop.\\n\\nIt seemed trivial, even insulting to edit a Word document in the presence of a man for whom valor and duty was a daily part of life; valour and sense of duty which he had so far attributed only to epical heroes.\\n\\nThe train slowed down as it pulled into the station, and Subedar Sushant picked up his bags to alight.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was nice meeting you sir.\\u201d\\n\\nVivek fumbled with the handshake.\\n\\nThis hand\\u2026 had climbed mountains, pressed the trigger, and hoisted the tricolour. Suddenly, as if by impulse, he stood up at attention and his right hand went up in an impromptu salute.\\n\\nIt was the least he felt he could do for the country.\\n\\nthe-proud-indian-flag-1\\n\\nPS:- The incident he narrated during the capture of Peak 4875 is a true-life incident during the Kargil war. Capt. Batra sacrificed his life while trying to save one of the men he commanded, as victory was within sight. For this and various other acts of bravery, he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the nation\\u2019s highest military award.\\r\\n[6/19/15, 12:29:12 AM] Satyajeet: Watch \"Samsung \"The Safety Truck\"\" on YouTube - https://youtu.be/ZetSRWchM4w\\nInnovative Technology \\U0001f44c\\U0001f44c\\U0001f44c\\r\\n[6/19/15, 12:56:37 AM] Satyajeet: Nua gita mukti laabha karila\\nKrupa kariki nirola re sunantu \\n\\nCheck out this video on YouTube:\\n\\nhttp://youtu.be/rm7O6AJw-Rc\\r\\n[6/19/15, 1:37:44 AM] Sampad Mishra: Couldn\\'t stop my laughter after reading this one. \\n  \\nA new vacuum cleaner salesman knocked at the door\\u2026.\\n\\nA lady opened it.

The lawyer teacher was Protagoras (c.485-415 BCE) and the student was Euthalos. This is known as Protagoras\\'s Paradox. This case was not solved. The most interesting part - this is still debated (even today) in law schools as a logic problem! \\n\\nMany years ago, a Law teacher came across a student who was willing to learn but was unable to pay the fees. \\xa0The student struck a deal saying, \\xa0\"I will pay your fee the day I win my first case in the court\". \\nTeacher agreed and proceeded with the law course. When the course was finished and teacher started pestering the student to pay up the fee, the student reminded him of the deal and pushed days. \\nFed up with this, the teacher decided to sue the student in the court of law and both of them decided to argue for themselves.\\n\\nThe teacher put forward his argument saying: \\xa0\"If I win this case, as per the court of law, the student has to pay me as the case is about his non-payment of dues. \\nAnd if I lose the case, student will still pay me because he would have won his first case. \\nSo either way I will have to get the money\".\\n\\n\\xa0Equally brilliant, the student argued back saying: \\xa0\"If I win the case, as per the court of law, I don\\'t have to pay anything to the teacher as the case is about my non-payment of dues. And if I lose the case, I don\\'t have to pay him because I haven\\'t won my first case yet. \\nSo either way, I am not going to pay the teacher anything\".\\n\\nThis is one of the greatest paradoxes ever recorded.\\n\\n\\xa0Who is right and who is the winner? \\U0001f604\\U0001f44d\\r\\n\\u200e[11/4/15, 10:33:37 AM] Ajay Garg: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[11/4/15, 11:02:51 PM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[11/6/15, 3:44:36 AM] Tareni: TinyHowl?

In short, they are into a recycling game, using new property sales to fund old ones. That\\u2019s why they lure you with 20:80 and 10:20:70 schemes, or ask you to pay only Rs 2-3 lakh for booking, and rest on possession. They want the upfront cash in the hope that prices will rise after a while to make this worthwhile.\\n\\nTake another measure: rental yield on residential property \\u2013 the annual potential rental income as a percentage of its market price \\u2013 is so low in India, that it makes no sense as an investment. Of course, returns will have to include the chances of future appreciation, but this means investment is being planned purely on expectations of a price rise. What if that isn\\u2019t happening too?\\n\\nIn any rational property market, rental yields ought to be somewhat in sync with borrowing costs. So if the housing finance companies are lending you money to buy a house at, say, 9.5 percent today, you should be earning at least half that by way of rental yield, hoping to make up the other half through capital appreciation.\\n\\nBut in most cities in India, even on the periphery, rental yields are in the range of 2-2.5 percent. I bought a small 1-BHK flat in Thane (a satellite city north-east of Mumbai) two-and-a-half years ago and the rental yield is currently around 2-2.5 percent. I bought the house to live in, but if I had bought it as an investment, I would have been better off leaving my money in a savings bank account. I essentially borrowed money at a high rate (10.75 percent in my case) to earn 2.5 percent. If I had not bought it to stay in it, I ought to be a candidate for the loony bin.\\n\\nSo let\\u2019s get this straight: real estate in India is overpriced and simply not good enough as investment, and the anecdotal stories about the high prices some people got for their properties are really no indication of what might happen in future.\\n\\nA\\xa0research study in 2013\\xa0found that rental yields the world over were significantly higher than fixed deposit rates offered by banks - or were at least comparable. India was the only exception, with rental yields being in the 2-3 percent range in major cities, and FD rates above 8.5 percent (at that time, that is).\\n\\nA comment by Vivek Kaul here quotes an Ambit report as saying that Indian rental yields make no sense. Analysts Saurabh Mukherjea and Sumit Shekhar of Ambitwrote: \\u201cIn a fairly-priced real estate market, the rental yield tends to be somewhere close to the cost of borrowing. Instead, Mumbai has a rental yield of close to 2 percent (this is gross of tax and maintenance charges) whilst the lending rate hovers around 10 percent. The difference between lending rates and rental yields is one of the highest.\\u201d\\n\\nThe key question is why. And the answer is clear. The property market is rigged. This is why despite low demand, prices quoted are still high and yields so low. If the property market were to function as efficiently as the stock market, real estate prices should crash, but the market is not being allowed to equate real demand with supply.\\n\\nIf one accepts 4-5 percent rental yields as a reasonable level at which property makes some investment sense, it means prices have to crash almost 50-80 percent from current levels to equate demand and supply.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s also consider another yardstick. If anyone is to buy property, incomes must be sufficient to cover monthly instalments. In Mumbai and Thane, most properties in the 800 sq ft 2 BHK range are above Rs 1 crore, even assuming some discounts have been offered to genuine buyers with the cash to pay for it all.\\n\\nTo buy a property worth Rs 1 crore, you need to raise a loan of around Rs 80 lakh. A 20-year loan at 9.5 percent would involve a monthly EMI of around Rs 75,000. To pay an EMI of Rs 75,000 (assuming you have no other loans for car, etc), and assuming Rs 50,000 monthly expenses, you would need a gross salary of at least Rs 2 lakh a month. And remember, to earn that kind of money on a 20-year loan, you need a remainder working life of at least 20 years. You can\\u2019t be older than 40-45.\\n\\nHow many people in Mumbai or any other metro do you think earn that kind of monthly salary? Sure, some Dinks (double-income-no-kids) could cobble up that kind of salary together, but the total numbers would not run into more than a few thousand in any city. Most middle class people thus head for suburbs well outside the cities.\\n\\nThe fundamental reason why property prices have to fall is because they are no longer affordable to the vast majority of Indian middle class households.\\n\\nThe problem with predicting a real estate/property price crash is that you will look wrong most of the time. People were expecting a 2008 global financial crisis three or four years before it happened, but for much of the time before 2008 they looked like cassandras.\\n\\nAnd so it will be with Indian real estate. Those predicting a crash will look foolish for a couple of years, but prophetic when it actually happens. The current level of property price is unsustainable. It has to crash. Just that we don\\u2019t know when that will happen. It could also happen through a prolonged period of stagnation in prices, where incomes rise faster than property prices for, say, a decade. The crash will happen then in slow motion, so that incomes and property prices are better aligned. But as of now, property is not a worthwhile investment in most places.\\n\\n1.9K204\\n\\nR Jagannathan\\n\\nJagannathan is Editorial Director, Swarajya.

The table gives the details about individuals who pay income tax in India. This is for the assessment year 2012-2013.

Of this nearly 56.4% or 1.62 crore did not pay any income tax. The rest, that is, around 1.25 crore individuals paid income tax. \\n\\nOf the 1.25 crore who paid income tax, nearly 1.11 crore individuals or 89% paid an income tax of less than Rs 1.5 lakh, for the assessment year 2012-2013. In total, these individuals paid an income tax of Rs 23,446 crore. This works out to an average of Rs 21,069. Of course, the median tax paid would be even lower than this. \\n\\nHence, 89% of those who paid tax in India in the assessment year 2012-2013, paid an average income tax of just over Rs 21,000 for the year. This means an average income tax of less than Rs 2,000 per month. \\n\\nThis means around 14 lakh Indians (13.90 lakhs to be precise) actually got around to paying some income tax. They paid around Rs 91,110 crore of income tax in total. \\n\\nIt is safe to say here that the average Indian does not pay income tax. Now let\\'s compare this to some consumption numbers. Take the case of car sales. In 2011-2012, around 25.34 lakh cars were sold. \\n\\nWhat does this tell us? In a country where around 13.90 lakh individuals actually pay some income tax, 25.34 lakh cars are sold during the course of the year. In fact, the number of cars sold has continued to be in the range of 23.4-25.6 lakh cars a year, since then. This basically tells us that many people who are buying cars are not paying any income tax. \\n\\nThis could be because of two reasons. One reason could be that those earning income from agriculture, which is tax free, are buying cars. The other and the more likely reason is that cars are being bought with money on which income tax has not been paid i.e. cars are being bought with black money. \\n\\nAlso, if we look at the income distribution of the salaried individuals paying income tax, around 20.2 lakh people had declared incomes between Rs 5.5 lakh and Rs 9.5 lakh, in the assessment year 2012-2013. But the total number of cars sold during the year stood at greater than 25 lakhs. It is safe to say here that those buying cars are earning at least Rs 5 lakh per annum. The question is, who is buying these cars then? \\n\\nIn short, it is safe to come to the conclusion that a significant portion of the cars are being bought by those who have black money. \\n\\nThe good news is that it shouldn\\'t be very difficult for income tax authorities to figure out who these people are, given the information technology infrastructure that is available these days. Of course, it may not be feasible for them to go after each and every such individual.\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:34:58 PM] Satyajeet: Guys I have a news to share\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:36:50 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: what\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:36:51 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: ?\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:37:32 PM] Satyajeet: Planning to move out of current role\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:39:00 PM] Satyajeet: basically the current leadership of my previous team in HUMANA well now it\\'s Aetna has offered me to join back and lead a team\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:39:57 PM] Sampad Mishra: Cool!\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:40:19 PM] Sampad Mishra: So deloite was marriage trick!\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:44:47 PM] Nirjhar Bhattacharya: good\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:59:08 PM] Satyajeet: Not a marriage trick, just a career move necessary to move into the secure realm of full time job opportunity\\r\\n[5/10/16, 1:59:57 PM] Satyajeet: However HUMANA/ Aetna now offers a better GC processing terms than Deloitte\\r\\n[5/10/16, 2:00:15 PM] Sampad Mishra: GC?\\r\\n[5/10/16, 2:01:04 PM] Satyajeet: Green Card\\r\\n[5/10/16, 2:01:07 PM] Sampad Mishra: GC as in CC, nirjhar help me out here...\\r\\n[5/10/16, 2:01:13 PM] Sampad Mishra: Lol\\r\\n[5/10/16, 2:01:35 PM] Satyajeet: I know it\\'s not that usual\\r\\n[5/10/16, 10:54:47 PM] Ashish Patel: Abey kisiko idea hain\\r\\n[5/10/16, 10:54:53 PM] Ashish Patel: Phone insurance  ka\\r\\n[5/10/16, 10:55:00 PM] Ashish Patel: Which one is good\\r\\n[5/10/16, 10:55:58 PM] Tareni: Avinash can guide\\r\\n[5/10/16, 10:56:09 PM] Tareni: Syska is one which is promoted most\\r\\n[5/10/16, 10:57:18 PM] Ashish Patel: Syska...

News are being given in a manner which are creating wrong impression in public. The only article that has analysed the issue in rational manner and which came to my notice is that written by Shri  Ravish. Rest are saying that the salary of govt employees has become more than doubled as if those who were getting gross salary of say Rs. 50,000 as on 31.12.2015 will be getting more tha Rs. 1 lakh. It is not true. As on 01. 01. 2016, there was 119% of DA (to offset the effect of inflation) on basic salary which will become zero once salary is fixed as per 7th pay commission. So as on 01. 01. 2016, govt employees were already getting more than double of the basic salary. As on 01.01.2016, employee at basic salary of Rs.7000 was getting Rs. 15330 as salary plus DA which will now be Rs 18000 and hence the increase for him is only of Rs 2670. Considering Housing allowance and Traveling allowance, total increase in gross salary is about 23.5%. This increase is given after 10 years and will continue to be the same for another 10 years. \\nNow the question comes, is it more or less? Let\\'s examine it objectively. \\n23.5% is the real hike in the salary of the employees over 10 years which is over and above the 3% annual increment. This increase is to be seen in the backdrop of economic growth over a decade. On an average Indian economy has grown @ 7.6% in the last decade. This, with annual increment of 3%, actual growth in the income of Govt employees lagged behind by 4.6% per annum. Even by simple arithmetic calculation, over 10 years the salary could not keep pace with economic growth and lagged by 36% ( actually it comes to 57% by compounding method). Against this backdrop hike of 23.5% does not seem adequate specifically when this hike is going to stay for another 10 years. \\nI also watched some debate on the issue where comparison was made with private sectors. Let\\'s see this also. As per one report of 2015 the annual salary of Chairman/ CEOS of Indian companies were as follows: \\nKalanithi Maran Rs.59.89 crore, \\nKaveri Kalanithi Rs.59.89 crore, \\nNaveen Jindal Rs.54.98 crore,\\nKumar Magalam Birla Rs. 49.62 crore \\nPawan Munjal Rs. 32.73 crore\\nBrij Mohanlal Munjal Rs. 32.73 crore \\nSunil Kant Munjal Rs. 31.51 crore\\nP. R. R. Rajha Rs. 30.96 crore\\nMurli K Divi Rs. 26.46 crore \\nNow the Cabinet Secretary which is actually CEO of the Govt of India will be getting only 2.5 lakh per month or 30 lakh per annum.  where is the comparison? No, no, no don\\'t say that their salaries are inclusive of profit on their investment, not at all. Profits are separately taken as dividend etc. How many times you have heard debate on this fat pay cheque?  Do not say that public money is not involved there. All Public Ltd. Companies are getting  public money through public issues of shares. \\nNow, see the real terms picture. In the year 2006 those who were getting 7000 will now get 18000. In 2006, gold price was Rs 8400 per 10 gms which is at present Rs. 30000. An employee receiving Rs. 7000 was able to purchase 8.33 grams of gold with one month salary while with enhanced salary of Rs. 18000 he will be able to buy only 6 grams of gold today. Is this a cause for cheer and all these debates ? If comparison is made in terms of real estate price rise, the situation will be worse. \\nSome more examples will open the eyes of the critics. Annual fee of IIT has been recently enhanced from Rs. 50 thousand to Rs 2 lakhs. 4 times hike. If a middle level officer\\'s both son qualify for IIT, he will have to pay Rs. 34000 per month towards fee only. Even if his salary is about Rs 75000, he won\\'t be able to afford this fee. As out of Rs 75000, about 7000 will go towards income tax, 5000 towards GPF, 15000 house rent. He will be left with Rs 48000 and if fee of Rs 34000 is paid he will be left with Rs 14000 to feed the family and run the household. Is it possible?\\nHave you ever analysed how a journalist becomes owner of a news channel in short span of time? What\\'s the entry level salary and what is the amount involved in owning a news channel? Whether rise in that sector is lower compared to Central Govt employees?\\nIt is damn easy to talk about the salary, efficiency, morality and accountability of babus but it is damn difficult to live the life of a Govt servant. What is the accountability of media, corporate houses, various NGOs, those analysts ? Compared to them accountability of Govt employees is much higher.\\n\\n( Article forwarded )\\r\\n[7/3/16, 10:53:55 PM] Ajay Garg: https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time\\r\\n[7/3/16, 10:55:50 PM] Satyajeet: Abe aaram se forward karo ek padhna khatam kiya hi nahin ki aur ek forward\\r\\n[7/3/16, 10:56:50 PM] Ajay Garg: Sorry\\r\\n[7/4/16, 6:26:36 AM] Sampad Mishra: Parhi any goodnews?\\r\\n[7/4/16, 6:29:45 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Congratulations parhi :)\\r\\n[7/4/16, 6:54:49 AM] Avinash Parhi: Hi All,  blessed with baby girl last night.

This is how it works \\u2013 I get Rs.10 credited to my mobile phone account after my first SliQ call over 2G/3G. This covers approximately 42 three minute voice, or 8 three minute video calls or a combination. After these calls are completed, my account is \\u201crecharged\\u201d with another Rs.10, for as long as I keep using SliQ. On high speed networks, SliQ uses less data than other apps, so your calls are cheaper, too.\\n\\nSliQ also lets you watch video clips of your choice without having to search for them.\\n\\nGet it now from http://sliqbits.com/sliq and switch over to a better way of calling!\\r\\n[7/16/16, 5:40:54 AM] Sampad Mishra: @parhi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8T9jBPuVLA\\r\\n\\u200e[7/16/16, 1:13:24 PM] Satyajeet: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[7/16/16, 3:41:41 PM] Satyajeet: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[7/16/16, 4:57:11 PM] Sampad Mishra: Bandhook gwalaon ke khelne ke cheez nahin! \\U0001f602\\r\\n\\u200e[7/16/16, 5:03:51 PM] Satyajeet: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[7/16/16, 7:43:00 PM] Satyajeet: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[7/17/16, 2:54:00 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[7/17/16, 2:54:24 AM] Sampad Mishra: Reliance jio in rourkela!

It is because if you look at user demographics active on Ecommerce tend to be more educated and come from higher income group based on which it is safe to conclude that they do come from higher income group.\\r\\n[8/15/16, 10:26:54 PM] Satyajeet: An interesting story related to Walmart I would like to share with you, one of my colleagues at my former workplace told me that in posh/upscale suburbs they do have a strong lobby to prevent Walmart from setting up stores as it does lead to inflow of unpleasant people in the neighborhood\\r\\n[8/15/16, 10:29:12 PM] Satyajeet: Now let\\'s look at Walmarts logistics, it already has an extensive supply chain network for its stores much before even Amazon came into existence but has not been able to catch up with Amazon on Ecommerce sales volume.\\r\\n[8/15/16, 10:30:10 PM] Satyajeet: My two cents I look at Jets.com as just another website which will coexist with Amazon but won\\'t become a market leader\\r\\n[8/15/16, 10:31:51 PM] Satyajeet: similar to Lyft which came after UBER but hasn\\'t been able to drive sales against UBER\\r\\n[8/15/16, 10:34:05 PM] Satyajeet: If Jets.com does team with SAMS CLUB it might be able to shed Walmart\\'s cheap perception\\r\\n[8/16/16, 12:28:32 AM] Sampad Mishra: Gwala you are into analytics, don\\'t talk rubbish, why Walmart will want to shed it\\'s cheap perception, jets will try to sell cheaper than amazon with free delivery like prime.\\r\\n[8/16/16, 12:28:34 AM] Sampad Mishra: Now give me stats what is sales of amazon and Walmart and bottomline\\r\\n[8/16/16, 2:39:52 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: If assortment is same in Walmart and Amazon people don\\'t care who sells , it boils down to customer experience and price. What Walmart gained is a full fledged e-commerce platform to complement it\\'s already awesome supply chain\\r\\n[8/16/16, 3:58:26 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u261dcompletely agree\\r\\n[8/16/16, 4:53:17 AM] Avinash Parhi: Many\\xa0studies\\xa0and\\xa0unscientific price comparisons\\xa0indicate that Lore is correct concerning the fact that Jet.com often beats Amazon on price, and that Amazon doesn\\u2019t quite dominate the low price battle as it once did. Instead, Amazon\\u2019s success is increasingly relying on the strategy of turning casual shoppers into Prime subscribers. Once they\\u2019re members, their\\xa0spending at Amazon tends to increase\\xa0significantly due to convenience, habit, and the appearance of saving money via competitive (if not the absolute cheapest) prices and free two-day shipping. Prime\\u2019s other perks, like free Prime Video streaming and unlimited photo storage, serve as incentives for paying subscribers to keep being paying subscribers, even after they realize that other sites may be cheaper than Amazon.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s through this strategy that Amazon has gained a\\xa0stranglehold on wealthy Americans\\xa0in particular, with more than 70% of upper-income households subscribing to Prime. Again, in all likelihood these folks are making far more purchases via Amazon than the average shopper. And Amazon likes this group especially to be frequent customers because of the obvious: They have lots of money to spend.\\r\\n[8/16/16, 4:54:19 AM] Avinash Parhi: I found this online and copy pasted here\\r\\n[8/16/16, 4:56:36 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Yup .. during my MBA days we had a prof who was a seed funder of jet.com\\r\\n[8/16/16, 4:56:52 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: In fact they are erstwhile diaper.com\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:04:44 AM] Avinash Parhi: Yes which was sold to Amazon in 2020\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:49:36 AM] Ashish Patel: In 2020\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:49:57 AM] Ashish Patel: In a parallel world which is ahead of us by 10 years\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:49:59 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\U0001f644\\U0001f914\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:50:27 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: 2002 bey\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:50:30 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Typo hoga\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:50:47 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: Read the case of diapers.com\\r\\n[8/16/16, 5:51:12 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: It was sold for 500mn I guess and it sold only diapers\\r\\n[8/16/16, 6:09:19 AM] Avinash Parhi: Yes\\r\\n[8/16/16, 6:09:30 AM] Avinash Parhi: 2010 i meant\\r\\n[8/16/16, 6:24:10 AM] Satyajeet: I have never said that Walmart wants to shed it\\'s cheap perception, people in general tend to perceive Walmart stuff as cheap.\\r\\n[8/16/16, 6:25:41 AM] Satyajeet: This is based on what I have seen in this country for last 6 years\\r\\n[8/16/16, 6:26:01 AM] Sampad Mishra: So are they driven by unpleasant and cheap people only.

Avinash Parhi: E-commerce transactions in the US totalled over $340 billion in 2015, a 14.6% increase over 2014\\u2019s sales of $298.3 billion, according to non-adjusted estimates released by the U.S. Department of Commerce. At $23 billion, India\\u2019s online retail transactions were way too small in comparison but the fact that the market grew 67% over the previous year makes it very attractive for those wanting to set foot here.\\n\\nWhile it\\u2019s an undeniable that Walmart is a global giant that employs around 2.3 million people in its 11,527 stores across 28 countries and churned $482 billion in total revenue last year, the world\\u2019s largest retailer is definitely worried about its declining online sales in the US while Amazon continues to grow impressively, both in the US and India. Also, Walmart\\u2019s online sales were a mere $13.6 billion in 2015 against Amazon\\u2019s $107 billion.\\r\\n[8/16/16, 2:23:59 PM] Sampad Mishra: Guys I am coming to B\\'lore tomorrow, will reach by 4pm,who is coming to receive me, don\\'t fight and  decide among yourself!\\r\\n[8/16/16, 2:24:09 PM] Avinash Parhi: Walmart\\u2019s own strengths as an offline retailer alongside its access to smart technology and \\u2018real time pricing algorithm\\u2019 it now owns with the acquisition of Jet.com, can boost its India play. The technology helps in reducing prices of products in real time based on various factors including the number of products and the distribution centres. This has the potential to revolutionize the prevailing customer experience and pricing patterns in the Indian e-commerce industry where deep discounting has become the bane for most companies.\\n\\nMoreover, the timing seems right for enterprises with large pockets to bid for Flipkart whose valuation took a beating in recent times before seeing two slight mark-ups. Flipkart suffered seven successive markdowns with some of its investors placing the e-commerce company\\u2019s valuation at less than $10 billion in comparison to $15.2 billion valuation it commanded till September last year, which was based on in its last funding round in mid-2015.\\n\\n\\u201cIt makes sense for a company like Walmart to enter India through an acquisition,\\u201d says Manish Kumar, CEO of GREX and a senior partner at early-stage venture capital firm IncuCapital Advisors.\\n\\nKumar adds that India, like China, is an atypical country and has very different environment including, but not limited to, customer sensitivity and values as well as regulatory environment. Then, the recent examples, for instance that of cab aggregator Uber signing off from China, have lessons in them for companies wanting to do business in China. Kumar argues that instead of starting out afresh in India, learning the rules of the game and then, scale up like Amazon, it makes sense for a latecomer like Walmart to simply buy an up and running enterprise.

His name Dhritiman Biswas. He spoke extempore and the points are reproduced here. The topic was a round table on: \\'India - is it a gigantic success or a colossal failure?\\'\\nThis is what he said:\\n\"Ladies and Gentleman, I am glad I am merely introducing the debate and not participating as in my humble opinion the question itself is wrong. India, unlike, many western paradigms cannot be analysed in black and white.. in linear equations or algorithms such as this.... We hate test cricket yet are the No1 test ranked country; our ranking in gender diversity is 134, yet the majority of our bank CEOs, the most misogynist yet of industries are women; our health services creak and crumble, yet 36 pct of all NHS consultants are Indians; we love Bollywood tamasha, yet New York philharmonic sold out in 5 mnts in Calcutta in 1984; we struggle with illiteracy, yet are the largest English speaking country in the world; we riot, fight and squabble, yet remain a thriving democracy whilst Russia, Arabia, Brazil, Pakistan fall to authoritarianism...India is a concept devised by the British and therefore in many ways a contradiction, a process , a work in progress. Our poverty index suggests we are a hopeless failure, our mobile usage however may allude to resounding success. Our private sector defaults diabolically like Kingfisher but spectacularly turnaround JLR like TATA. This question cannot be answered because it is the wrong question to ask. The right question is - can India be allowed to fail? JP Morgan elegantly points to the ruins of emerging markets and says India is a nice house in a bad street! I would add further... The western world is founded on the principles of liberal, free market, democracy... Outside the OECD and the western Anglo Saxon Protestant world, literally in the entire globe there is one other example of this experiment and that is India...we are the West and England\\'s most natural ally...

This was basically done to stem the growth of unfair trade practices. However, times have changed now, we are in a stage of open competition. Organized retail has grown a lot. On one hand, I do agree that removing MRP would be unfair on mom-n-pop shops, however, for organised retail, it will be a major boost. From my personal experience in EU, where these is no MRP mandating, the organised retail has boomed to a huge extent. Free market has resulted in big retail chains like ICA, Willys\\' to flourish. In my humble opinion, if MRP mandating by government is removed, it would be upto retail chains to price products according to their capability.\\n\\nSecondly, FDI in retail is not being implemented full fledged as a lot of retail chains have been apprehensive because of restrictive trade policies implemented 25 years back. MRP mandate is one of them.\\n\\nLastly, one more concern on my part is that at present the countries that have MRP mandate are lacking behind in growth. We have thus been labelled as \\'3rd\\' world. All \\'1st\\' world countries have long rejected MRP in favour of MSRP(even that is not mandatory).\\n\\nIf we are to develop to match their capability and even succeed in overtake, these kinds of restrictions need to be releaved off. Let us allow organised retailers to price products according to their capability and let the law of supply and demand have it\\'s say.\\r\\n[9/13/16, 12:32:06 PM] Avinash Parhi: I didnt knew mrp is nt mandate in EU.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be issuing Rs 2,000 currency notes, the highest to come into circulation, even as some experts feel7 high-value denominations should be discontinued to curb black money.\\n\\nThe Rs 2000 currency is designed keeping in mind to eradicate the black money issues using state of the art indigenous nano technology, every Rs. 2000 currency note is embedded with a *NGC (Nano GPS Chip)*\\n\\n*How the embeded NGC Technology Works?*\\nThe unique feature of the NGC is it dosent need any power source. It only acts as a signal reflector. When a Satellite sends a signal requesting location the NGC reflects back the signal from the location, giving precise location coordinates, and the serial number of the currency back to the satellite, this way every NGC embedded currency can be easily tracked & located even if it is kept 120 meters below ground level. The NGC cant be tampered with or removed without damaging the currency note\\n\\n*How will this help eradicate black money menace?*\\nSince every NGC embeded currency can be tracked. The satellite can identify the exact amount of money stored at a certain location. If a relatively high concentration of currency is found a certain location for a longer period of time at suspicious locations other than banks & other financial institutions. The information will be passed on to the Income Tax Department for further investigation\\n\\n*Just a beginning of the end of black money in India*\\r\\n[11/8/16, 10:28:31 AM] Sampad Mishra: Buying gold.. \\U0001f60e\\r\\n[11/8/16, 10:28:59 AM] Ashish Patel: Abhi 12 baje se pehle ?\\r\\n[11/8/16, 10:29:48 AM] Sampad Mishra: Already bought!

The entire cast & crew would stand up every time the veteran actor walked in, but the Church Park educated, English speaking Jayalalitha sat there with her legs crossed, reading her book. It was this audacity that went on to define the rest of her political career. Obviously, she was a charming, multi-faceted actor who was trained in various dance forms. But not so obviously, she was well read and witty, she was intelligent and she knew it. It was not merely her affair with MGR that drew her to politics, it was her prolific ability to speak in English & Hindi with an intellect that could match an economist. When MGR died, she sat conspicuously at his head for an entire two days, relegating his wife Janaki to a sidelined spot. Janaki\\u2019s aids tried to push her away, in fact pinched her, stepped on her feet, but she refused to budge. When she got on to the carriage for the final procession, she was visibly pushed off it in front of all television cameras. This effrontery was what would help her survive all those years of politics that would follow. The entire party split into two after MGR\\u2019s death, but four years later united under her leadership to form one formidable opposition.\\nShe won against all odds. She was a white skinned Brahmin in a party that thrived due to its Dravidian anti-class rhetoric. She was a glamorous actor who cannot, by definition, be taken seriously. Above all, she was a woman trying to ascend to power in 1980s in Tamil Nadu. An unmarried, childless woman. To put it in context, she was not only walking a path of thorns, she did it in an oxygen less chamber while her arms and legs were tied. It\\u2019s a feat that she survived at all, not to mention that she actually thrived. In 1989, when she opposed Karunanidhi\\u2019s presentation of the budget, she was almost disrobed in the assembly. This was in addition to being the recipient of lewd comments and hair pulling. This is probably the highest documented insult that a woman has ever faced in a state Assembly. Yet she persisted. She came out of that incident more guarded than ever before. She wrapped herself in layers of clothing and stopped wearing any jewelry at all. She succeeded at \\u2018desexualizing\\u2019 herself and branded herself as \\u2018amma\\u2019 (mother), the only known way to gain respect in that highly testosterone filled environment.\\nEveryone knows her as the person who silences opposition and who creates sycophants who fall at her feet and worship her. This was the only possible way she could command, consolidate and hold on to the otherwise elusive power. If she was any more cordial than this, she might have as well been an airhostess.\\nShe played popular politics. When the DMK promised laptops, she provided table fans, mixers and grinders instead all branded with her cherubic photograph on it. She accumulated disproportionate assets in 1996, and has faced her share of atonement. However, no one else, not even men, could have been a formidable opposition to the DMK that has systematized corruption and nepotism in ways that she couldn\\u2019t. Forget her followers who baselessly immolate themselves or cut off their fingers in a spree of blind devotion towards her. I have spoken to several civil servants of the state who claim they function with lesser interference under her leadership than under the other party.\\nAnd with four and a half years of her term left, there is no single leader that can fill her void. It will be several years, even decades, before another woman can even remotely achieve what she did in a state like Tamil Nadu. Now her statues will come up all over the state, and for once I\\u2019m glad. In a few generations, all that will matter is that there is a woman\\u2019s statue as well, and that statue is not a mere kannagi who was venerated because she was a perfect wife, but of a woman who was a true and powerful leader of her own merit and her own making.\\r\\n[12/7/16, 12:44:46 AM] Tareni: This Harvard student\\u2019s Facebook post on Jayalalithaa is going viral\\r\\n\\u200e[12/7/16, 2:43:28 AM] Ashish Patel: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[12/7/16, 12:43:00 PM] Avinash Parhi: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[12/8/16, 8:24:10 AM] Satyajeet: http://m.economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/flipkarts-sachin-bansal-olas-bhavish-aggarwal-seek-governments-help-in-battle-against-amazon-uber/articleshow/55862027.cms\\r\\n\\u200e[12/8/16, 8:46:18 PM] Ajay Garg: \\u200evideo omitted\\r\\n\\u200e[12/10/16, 1:26:49 PM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[12/10/16, 1:27:31 PM] Sampad Mishra: Uber india is making profit while ola is still in red!

A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. \\n\\nA breath and a cough must be repeated about every two\\nseconds without let-up until help arrives, or until\\nthe heart is felt to be beating normally again.\\n\\n8 Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing\\nmovements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. \\n\\n9 Tell as many other people as possible about this.

This is out of the box thinking \\U0001f447\\r\\n[3/1/17, 2:04:14 PM] Tareni: A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO JRD TATA IN 1974...\\n\\nWorth reading...\\n\\nIt was April of 1974. I was the only girl in my\\npostgraduate department and was staying at the ladies\\' hostel.\\n\\nI was looking forward to going abroad to complete a doctorate in computer science.\\n\\nI had been offered scholarships from Universities in the US.\\n\\nI had not thought of taking up a job in India.\\n\\nWhile on the way to my hostel from our lecture-hall complex, I saw an advertisement on the notice board.\\n\\nIt was a standard job requirement notice from the automobile company Telco (Tata Motors).\\n\\nIt stated that the company required young, bright engineers, hardworking and with an excellent academic background, etc.\\n\\nAt the bottom was a small line: *Lady Candidates need not apply.*\\n\\nI read it and was very upset.\\n\\nFor the first time in my life I was up against gender discrimination.\\n\\nThough I was not keen on taking up the job, I saw it as a challenge.\\n\\nAfter reading the notice I went fuming to my room.\\n\\nI got a postcard and started to write, but there was a problem: I did not know who headed Telco.\\n\\nI knew JRD Tata was the head of the Tata Group; I had seen his pictures in newspapers (actually, Sumant Moolgaokar was the company\\'s chairman then).\\n\\nI took the card, addressed it to JRD and started writing..\\n\\nTo this day I remember clearly what I wrote. \\n\\n\"The great Tatas have always been pioneers. They\\nare the people who started the basic infrastructure industries in India, such as iron and steel, chemicals, textiles and locomotives they have cared for higher education in India since 1900 and they were responsible for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science. Fortunately, I study there. But I am surprised how a company such as Telco is discriminating on the basis of gender.\"\\n\\nI posted the letter and forgot about it.\\n\\nLess than 10 days later, I received a telegram stating that I had to appear for an interview at Telco\\'s Pune facility at the company\\'s expense.\\n\\nI was taken aback by the telegram.\\n\\nMy hostel mate told me I should use the opportunity to go to Pune free of cost and buy them the famous Pune saris for cheap!\\n\\nI collected Rs 30 each from everyone who wanted a sari.. when I look back, I feel like laughing at the reasons for my going.\\n\\nIt was my first visit to Pune and I immediately fell in love with the city. The place changed my life in so many ways.\\n\\nAs directed, I went to Telco\\'s Pimpri office for the interview.\\n\\nThere were six people on the panel and I realized then that this was serious business.\\n\\n*This is the girl who wrote to JRD*..I heard somebody whisper as soon as I entered the room.\\n\\nBy then I knew for sure that I would not get the job. The realization abolished all fear from my mind, so I was\\nrather cool while the interview was being conducted.\\n\\nThe panel asked me technical questions and I answered all of them.\\n\\nThen an elderly gentleman with an affectionate voice told me..\\'Do you know why we said lady candidates need not apply?\\n\\nThe reason is that we have never employed any ladies on the shop floor. This is not a factory. When it comes to academics, you are a first ranker throughout.\\n\\nWe appreciate that, but people like you should work in research laboratories.\\'\\n\\nI did not know the ways of large corporate houses, so I answered...\\'But you must start somewhere, otherwise no woman will ever be able to work in your factories.\\'\\n\\nFinally, after a long interview, I was told I had been successful.\\n\\nSo this was what the future had in store for me. Never had I thought I would take up a job in Pune.\\n\\nLater I met a shy young man from Karnataka\\nthere, we became good friends and we got married.\\n\\nIt was only after joining Telco that I realized who JRD was: the uncrowned king of Indian industry.\\n\\nNow I was scared, but I did not get to meet him till I was transferred to Bombay.\\n\\nOne day I had to show some reports to Mr Moolgaokar, our chairman.\\n\\nI was in his office on the first floor of Bombay House, the Tata headquarters, when JRD walked in.\\n\\nThat was the first time I saw \\'JRD\\'.\\n\\nI was feeling very nervous, remembering my postcard episode.\\n\\nSomeone introduced me..\\n\\n*This young woman is an engineer and She is the first woman to work on the Telco shop floor*\\n\\nJRD looked at me.\\n\\nI was praying he would not ask me any questions about my interview or the postcard that preceded it.\\n\\nThankfully, he didn\\'t.\\n\\nInstead, he remarked. \\'It is nice that girls are getting into engineering in our country. By the way, what is your name?\\'\\n\\n\\'When I joined Telco I was Sudha Kulkarni, Sir,\\'\\n\\nNow I am *Sudha Murthy*\\' \\n\\nHe smiled and kindly smile and started a discussion with SM.\\n\\nAs for me, I almost ran out of the room.\\n\\nAfter that I used to see JRD on and off.\\n\\nHe was the Tata Group chairman and I was merely an engineer. We had nothing in common..\\n\\nOne day I was waiting for Murthy, my husband, to pick me up after office hours.\\n\\nTo my surprise I saw JRD standing next to me. I did not know how to react..!\\n\\n\\'Young lady, why are you here?\\' he asked. \\'Office time is over.\\' \\n\\nI said, \\'Sir, I\\'m waiting for my husband to come and pick me up.\\' \\n\\nJRD said, \\'It is getting dark and there\\'s no one in the corridor. I\\'ll wait with you till your husband comes.\\'\\n\\nI was quite used to waiting for Murthy, but having JRD waiting alongside made me extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\nI was nervous.\\n\\nOut of the corner of my eye I looked at him. He wore a simple white pant and shirt. He was old, yet his face was glowing.\\n\\nThere wasn\\'t any air of superiority about him.\\n\\nI was thinking.. *Look at this person. He is a chairman, a well-respected man in our country and he is waiting for the sake of an ordinary employee.*\\n\\nThen I saw Murthy and I rushed out...\\n\\nJRD called and said, \\'Young lady, tell your husband never to make his wife wait again.\\' \\n\\nIn 1982 I had to resign from my job at Telco...\\n\\nWhen I was coming down the steps of Bombay House after wrapping up my final settlement when I saw JRD coming up.\\n\\nI wanted to say goodbye to him, so I stopped. He saw me and paused...\\n\\nGently, he said, \\'So what are you doing, Mrs. Kulkarni?\\'\\n\\n\\'Sir, I am leaving Telco.\\'\\n\\n\\'Where are you going?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Pune, Sir. My husband is starting a company called *Infosys* and I\\'m shifting to Pune.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh!

It\\'s not about high position though stakes are high there but professionalism of a person, that\\'s why in USA there is no law for maternity leave, it\\'s dependent company policy, if company are big enough and they are willing to invest on long term then it\\'s okay, but startups can\\'t afford it so no maternity leave, so if you are on leave you can be fired too. I think it\\'s the right approach, on a normal delivery one month is ok. Why 6 months, if woman is in high post she can afford maid or some help, or the husband can take leave. That\\'s the real equality. Don\\'t blame the company or management. Plan your personal thing.\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:32:15 AM] Satyajeet Anand Tripathy: \\U0001f44d\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:35:54 AM] Avinash Parhi: completely agree\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:37:04 AM] Tareni: Though I agree with what you said but 1 month does not work out. How do you expect the baby to be breast fed if the mother leaves after one month of delivery. At least 6 months is min doctor recommendation and that has to be there . India is way behind in recognising this . In fact cr\\xe8che also does not work out for 1st 6 months and post delivery physical recovery of women within 1 month is not practical\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:40:30 AM] Sampad Mishra: I dont agree,breast feed is not that important for survival,cow milk is ok,there are many cases when mother does not lactate,so i think its personal choice,and physical recovery is also fine within a month,and rest for taking care n hire a maid,no problem at all.Just dont blame the company.\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:41:01 AM] Sampad Mishra: and btw You can store breast milk.\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:42:02 AM] Sampad Mishra: and for your info i have some friends in US where creche works after one month too there.\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:43:24 AM] Tareni: That\\'s why said it is difficult in India to give importance to upbringing of baby and how u want to work out.  Go to any paediatrician and first thing they insist on mothers milk and not cow milk and cow milk is not supposed to be given till 1 yr because of fat content.  The natural immunity which baby gets from mother milk can never be replaced with lactose based baby products which the products themselves agree on their product description\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:44:09 AM] Tareni: So there is min way u want ur baby to grow in initial years which you should not compromise\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:44:24 AM] Tareni: Which companies also recognise\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:44:58 AM] Tareni: Further one has to look at the mental trauma a mother has to go through in leaving her new born baby and going to work\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:45:44 AM] Ajay Garg: Kya chutiya hai bey\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:45:56 AM] Ajay Garg: U are a father of two children\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:46:11 AM] Ajay Garg: Expected u sud know better\\r\\n[4/16/17, 4:46:14 AM] Tareni: So certain humane aspects are not be ignored because of practicality.

We saw women employees leaving in a year or two after joining citing marriage, new parenthood etc. This was happening in other departments too. \\nI can speak for Deloitte and Humana, both of these companies HR have a vision to have at least 50 % women in workforce by 2020. ( source: mentioned in the workforce diversity conferences).\\nIn HUMANA post 2015 I find this as a general trend in my team that young women employees have been there for more than 3 years and being able to continue even  after marriages and post pregnancy after being allowed to work from home. This is something that\\'s not only benefitting women as even men taking work from home in case there spouse is at a different location and not able to relocate.\\n\\nHaving shared the above work from home option. Women employees are given 4 months or 12 weeks of maternity leave and men are getting 4 weeks or one month of paternity leave which Humana is planning to increase to 4 months.\\n\\nSomething interesting I saw last year. One of our director went on maternity leave in May and she remained on leave for more than a year, our VP didn\\'t want to lose her and she wanted to spend time with her kid so they did the following \\n- Stepped down from her position as a director and one of her junior was promoted \\n- she took up a part-time role working two days a week for now and continues working as a mentor for her previous team along with being a consultant for our VP.\\nIt is anticipated that once her kid grows up and starts going to school then she can start full time again and build a new team.\\n\\nIn my opinion, it is a fact that we need kids to be a part of growing economies workforce in future. If we don\\'t support women now then we might see a reduction in rate of growth of our workforce.\\n\\nGermany, one of the developed countries allows women to go on maternity leave till their kids turn three and the employees can return back and join without having to fear for job termination\\r\\n\\u200e[4/17/17, 2:53:39 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[4/17/17, 2:53:43 AM] Sampad Mishra: #safronisation\\r\\n[4/17/17, 2:59:50 AM] Ajay Garg: Woah.. \\U0001f62f\\r\\n[4/17/17, 3:01:40 AM] Sampad Mishra: Ab lag raha hai, country is really going through some character change\\r\\n[4/17/17, 3:03:58 AM] Ajay Garg: This is intolerance\\r\\n[4/17/17, 3:05:43 AM] Sampad Mishra: No. I don\\'t think so, loudspeakers should be banned.\\r\\n[4/17/17, 3:06:28 AM] Sampad Mishra: Practice your religion but have tolerance towards majority people.

Husband asked wife, where to go?\\n\\nThinking that he likes Gujarati food, she said: \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Agashiye - The Terrace Restaurant!\\u201d\\n\\nHis son and daughter nodded in agreement.\\n\\nOn their return, the son remarked, \\u201cI wish Papa had taken us to Mainland China, as he loves Chinese food. Or at least to Shere-E-Punjab for the wonderful tandoori chicken.\\u201dadded his daughter.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I too would have loved to go Mainland China!\\u201d, the man said.\\n\\nWife looked surprised: \\u201cBut didn\\u2019t we all unanimously agree to go to Agashiye,\\u201d she asked.\\n\\nHe said sheepishly \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want you to feel bad.\\u201d And both children nodded in agreement.\\n\\nHere were four people who of their own volition would not have gone to \\u2018Agashiye - The Terrace Restaurant, but collectively agreed to go there.\\n\\nThis also happens in the corporate world. This is the Abilene Paradox.\\n\\nProf Jerry Harvey calls it \\'The Inability to Manage Agreement.\\'\\n\\nThe Abilene Paradox occurs when a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is contrary to the preferences of most of the individuals in the group.\\n\\nProf Harvey states in his paper \\u2018The Abilene Paradox\\u2019, \\u201cOrganizations frequently take actions in contradiction to what they really want to do and therefore defeat the very purpose they are trying to achieve\\u201d.\\n\\nThis is the inability to manage agreement.\\n\\nHe adds, \\u201cThe inability to manage agreement, not the inability to manage conflict, is the essential symptom that defines organizations caught in the web of the Abilene Paradox.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the corporate world, when the top boss throws an idea, the group immediately agrees.\\n\\nThis is because everyone in the group thinks he would look stupid if he disagrees.\\n\\nStanding out as a lone voice is very embarrassing. This leads the group to decide on \\u2018yes\\u2019 when \\u2018no\\u2019 would have been the personal (and the correct) response of the majority.\\n\\nIf the top boss always disagrees with rest of group, then the organization will never have group giving honest opinion.\\r\\n\\u200e[6/28/17, 4:03:22 AM] Sampad Mishra: \\u200eimage omitted\\r\\n[6/28/17, 4:18:14 AM] Ashish Patel: What is the

Before he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark \\u201cGood luck, Mr. Gorsky.\\u201d\\nMany people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, [they found] there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs.\\n\\nOver the years, many people have questioned him as to what the \\u201cGood luck, Mr. Gorsky\\u201d statement meant. On July 5, in Tampa Bay, FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26- year-old question to Armstrong. He finally responded. It seems that Mr. Gorsky had died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the question. When he was a kid, Neil was playing baseball with his brother in the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in front of his neighbors\\u2019 bedroom window. The neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky.

IL&FS is one of India\\u2019s largest financial conglomerates and infrastructure developers with a large NBFC, and infrastructure assets across power, roads and renewables. It has a marquee shareholder base, with LIC, SBI, HDFC, ADIA and Orix of Japan it\\u2019s largest shareholders. The company and its subsidiaries have more than Rs900 billion of debt outstanding, but were till recently AA+ rated and large issuers of bonds, commercial papers (CPs) and inter-corporate deposits.\\n\\nIn the month of September, the conglomerate has defaulted across multiple instruments, issued to various counter parties.\\n\\nThe problems and contagion these defaults are causing is the source of the current financial market stress.\\n\\nFirst, how can an issuer rated AA+ go into a default rating in 10 days? What were the rating agencies doing? I have heard of name-based lending, but name-based ratings? Given the credibility of this rating, the obvious concern among debt investors is who is the next such whale? Are there other large, complex financial entities and NBFCs where the rating, based more on the name than numbers, is suspect? Having been burnt once, debt investors are now in the risk-aversion mode. This creates a ripe environment for fear and rumour mongering. Any whispers of XYZ in trouble and immediately, investors, facing career risk, jump to exit all assets of this issuer at literally any price. Investors, many of whom have based their decisions on the ratings rather than common sense judgement and simple financial analysis, are being held hostage by their emotions and fear of their investment committees.\\n \\nSecond, mutual funds own almost Rs50 billion of IL&FS bonds. These bonds will have to be severely marked down. The funds will have to take the hit on their net asset value (NAV). \\n\\n\\nIllustration by Ajaya Mohanty\\nNot knowing who has how much IL&FS paper, marked at what price, investors are redeeming their funds, hoping to avoid the NAV hit. These debt funds, fearing redemptions are being forced to raise cash. Like mid-cap equities, Indian corporate bonds, in times of stress, are very illiquid. Who will buy and at what price? Everyone is on one side of this trade. This is creating price and yield dislocations. NBFC paper is in the eye of the storm, since NBFCs have been the most extensive issuers of bonds in the last few years, everybody has their paper, and where naturally balance sheet leverage is the maximum. Most of the money in debt funds is from corporates and high net worth investors. They are not used to seeing losses. If they redeem in mass, we have a real problem. If mutual funds will not buy NBFC papers, then who will? There is a risk that some financial entities will have issues rolling over their maturing obligations. If you cannot roll over your bonds/CP, then any institution will have severe liquidity challenges.\\n\\nThe equity markets are killing NBFC stocks, as their growth and profit assumptions, underlying the high valuations, are now in question. Most NBFCs will need at a minimum to slow down their growth. If they cannot fully fund in the debt markets, bank lines can only make up part of the gap. At a minimum, their cost of funds has risen by 125-150 basis points, leading to margin pressure. High multiple stocks are very sensitive to growth and margin assumptions. Any negative revision in either is corrosive for multiples. Markets no longer believe that most NBFCs can grow for years at 30 per cent-plus and sustain current ROA\\u2019s (return on assets), hence the multiple resets.\\n\\nThis has systemic issues as well. We all know the state of the PSU banks and their inability to lend. It was believed that private banks and NBFCs would fill the gap. Just when the underlying economy is picking up and credit demand is accelerating, these shocks have hit the system. If NBFCs have to slow their lending, can the remaining handful of private banks make up the difference? This looks difficult. This assessment is why many sectors where consumer credit is critical to growth like automobiles and housing have also come under equity market pressure. \\n\\nIndian macro conditions have been under pressure this year as it is. Surging oil prices, rising current account deficit (CAD), weakening rupee, deteriorating fiscal and rising rates have all pressured the macro. Now, this bout of risk aversion in debt markets puts further pressure. If not stabilised soon, we may see consequences on the country\\u2019s growth rates.\\nWhat needs to be done?\\n\\nThe RBI has to inject liquidity in size and quickly. They have already begun the process.  The debt market seizing up has very adverse consequences for liquidity, which has to be countered, in force and quickly. \\n\\nLiquidity lines and repo facilities have to be set up for the debt mutual funds. We cannot allow forced selling at panic prices. Panic selling will force other funds to also mark down their bonds, showing paper losses, creating more redemptions, more selling and we will spiral into a negative feedback loop. \\n\\nThose entities where yields have blown out due to lack of confidence, we need to see confidence building measures \\u2014 either compulsory: Immediate RBI audits to check the books and give a clean chit or very granular disclosures on both asset quality and liability profiles. These entities need to make special efforts to attract the most respected debt market investors into their paper at whatever cost. I call them lead steer investors. Others look towards these investors in times of stress, to provide leadership and direction. If they come in, the taint around your paper is removed. Much like a Buffet investing in Goldman Sachs (GS) in the depths of the Global Financial Crisis. It was a very expensive deal for GS but it stemmed the rot and brought confidence. Fresh equity issuance and lowering of leverage may also help to rebuild market confidence in these entities. For any financial institution, it is ultimately all about confidence. Without it, you have no future.\\n\\nThis crisis has been badly managed. With the shareholders that IL&FS has, how was it allowed to default? If they are willing to inject equity now, why wait till default? How was it allowed to build the leverage and ALM mismatch? What were the shareholders doing at the board? Even a cursory reading of the consolidated accounts indicates stress. How were the rating committees justifying an AA+ rating? There seems to have been a systemic breakdown of accountability and governance.

Perhaps the most consequential of those events happened on a Sunday afternoon around last Diwali.\\n\\nNaresh Goyal, along with his financial advisers, drove to Deepak Parekh\\u2019s Mumbai residence to seek advice on how to save Jet. Around that time, the Tatas were evaluating the option of buying Goyal\\u2019s troubled carrier. There was also a private equity consortium led by TPG Capital and Indigo Partners LLC, a specialist aviation investor.\\n\\nHDFC\\u2019s avuncular chairman Parekh \\u2014 key adviser to the Abu Dhabi government, the same Emirate where Etihad, Jet\\u2019s partner, is the state-owned carrier \\u2014 advised Goyal to step back and make way for a new investor.\\n\\nGoyal has many such important friends on speed dial \\u2014 politicians, policymakers, chief executives, airline lessors and manufacturers. He talks to them all, but finally listens only to himself. So he refused to relent or cede control last year, believing instead that he would pull a rabbit out of his hat, like always. But he couldn\\u2019t. Tata Sons, the only suitor with a comprehensive offer for Jet, walked off never to return.\\n\\nET spoke to multiple persons for this story. Many spoke off the record. A Jet spokesperson termed a detailed set of emailed queries sent earlier \\u201cspeculative.\\u201d The Tata group said it won\\u2019t comment. Parekh too declined to comment.\\n\\n\\u201cIn retrospect, perhaps Goyal ought to have put more faith in the people he hired to help run the airline,\\u201d said Shukor Yusof, founder of Malaysian research firm Endau Analytics. \\u201cHe does bear responsibility for many of the carrier\\u2019s strategic mistakes. He finds it hard to let go, and this has worsened the situation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGoyal has failed his company, his employees and his shareholders,\\u201d a top airline executive told ET. \\u201cHe had a readymade investment opportunity from Tata Sons, which he squandered. Jet was sailing till January. Then it all went downhill.\\u201d\\n\\nBy recent estimates, Jet Airways is making a daily loss of Rs 21 crore and has debt and dues of at least Rs 15,000 crore.\\n\\nJet\\u2019s fall is a story of the fall of its founder. Few business failures are so inseparable from the failings of their promoters. Industry insiders often quote a line attributed to Goyal, \\u201cI am the person in Jet. When people look at Jet Airways, they look at me.\\u201d The garrulous founder of the airline, admired by some for his quicksilver wit, was once its biggest asset. Today, he has proved to be its biggest liability.\\n\\nEven with Etihad on board, Goyal repeatedly flirted with Delta Air Lines. With an FY18 net income of close to $4 billion, annual cash flows of over $7 billion and almost no presence in the big Indian market, Delta could have been Jet\\u2019s richest suitor. It offered Rs 300 per share. But Goyal wanted over Rs 400.\\n\\nAll this when his airline\\u2019s shares price had hovered between Rs 182 and Rs 347 for the past six months.\\n\\n\\u201cDelta executives said, \\u2018Don\\u2019t just come to us for money. Come if you want us to help you turn around your airline\\u2019,\\u201d said the executive cited above. Delta declined to comment to ET.\\n\\nPOWER COUPLE\\u2019S DARBARS\\n\\nAirlines have always had flamboyant founders/chief executives known as much for their love of the high life as for their hospitality. Goyal is no exception. He is self-admittedly inspired as much by CP Krishnan Nair of the Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts and PRS Oberoi of the Oberoi Group as by any successful airline CEO or founder. He wanted Jet\\u2019s Mumbai-London passengers to get a five-star hotel experience.\\n\\nGoyal would hold meetings at his Mumbai and London homes and almost no one was allowed to leave without breaking bread with the family. When in London, the food would often come from Taj\\u2019s Bombay Brasserie, which also provided meals on Jet\\u2019s international flights.\\n\\nProblems arose when Goyal blurred the personal with the professional. And when he fell totally out of sync with industry disruptions, feel his peers.\\n\\nHe would hold meetings that employees termed \\u201cdarbars.\\u201d His room on the fifth floor of Siroya Centre, Jet\\u2019s corporate office in Mumbai, has a large round table with phones but no computers \\u2014 Goyal, until recently, used fax, read printouts of emails and has joined WhatsApp in the past year, said a Jet executive. Facing this table are couches where executives sat.\\n\\nGoyal would come into office post 1 pm, often summon heads of various departments, sermonise for hours and even take them to task publicly, caring little for designations such as head of planning and strategy. In Jet, Goyal was the sole planner and strategist. He liked to repeat things thrice for emphasis. His benchmark for efficiency was \\u201clike a Swiss clock\\u201d and he often cited Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Goyal was also extremely emotional about his staff, showing reluctance and sadness in laying off almost any employee.\\n\\nHis wife Anita, also called Neeta, (a board member who resigned with him on March 25) held similar darbars one floor down. She was kinder, though just as exacting, and kept tabs on how much every Jet flight earned or lost. She was known to informally call up the heads of other airlines \\u2014 Rahul Bhatia of IndiGo, Ajay Singh of SpiceJet and Jeh Wadia of GoAir (Naresh Goyal called chairman Nusli Wadia) \\u2014 when they cut prices too much. Her associates called her sense of revenue management \\u201creactive.\\u201d\\n\\nGoyal and his wife would often differ on many aspects of the airline business but they agreed on one thing always: total control. At the end of 2018, for instance, when the cash crunch was deepening, Jet announced a slew of discounted offerings to fill its planes \\u2014 a move that was objected to by CEO Vinay Dube.\\n\\nAn executive from Delta, Dube didn\\u2019t find the model sustainable for a full-service carrier already burdened by costs. However, Anita Goyal shot down Dube\\u2019s objection and asked him not to interfere, as it was \\u201cher airline.\\u201d\\n\\nNumbers tell the rest of the story \\u2014 those forward bookings gave the airline interim cash, but have now become a liability of Rs 3,500 crore worth of cancellations for around 3.2 million passengers. It has indeed been Dube who has kept the airline running in the past few months, pacifying angry creditors and encouraging distressed staff. Former executives say the Goyals\\u2019 biggest mistake has been placing too much trust in a handful of individuals.\\n\\nThere were \\u201ccamps\\u201d close to Goyal and his wife. The company was \\u201ctoo personality-driven.\\u201d The couple frequently changed management decisions. For instance, the management would enforce additional duties on pilots or crew. But sometimes, a crew member would call up Goyal directly, and decisions would be overturned.\\n\\nAs Jet plunged financially, the darbars became infrequent, and stopped completely after September. But the Jet story isn\\u2019t just about Mr and Mrs Goyal. There was the son, Nivaan, too.\\n\\nFATHER\\u2019S BURDEN\\n\\nNivaan was mentored at Jet by former chief executive Cramer Ball and then Jayaraj Shanmugam, currently executive vice-president of products and services. He worked with various departments before joining the business transformation team set up to turn around the airline and finally became a close aide of his father.\\n\\nFormer colleagues have said Nivaan never threw his weight around. Yet, many often found him detached. \\u201cBall used to call assessment meetings with the top management. Nivaan would attend every meeting, but never said anything relevant,\\u201d said an executive who was part of these meetings.\\n\\nUnlike his parents, Nivaan was more amenable to giving the management a free hand. Sometimes, he would be the \\u2018nicer\\u2019 Goyal when his father upbraided an executive. But his parents didn\\u2019t let him take any key decisions.\\n\\nFollowing Goyal\\u2019s cardiac ailment, Nivaan asked his father to allow him, Anita and the management to run the airline. Even then, Naresh Goyal didn\\u2019t budge. A few weeks ago (around March 18), when Etihad said it didn\\u2019t want to be part of Jet\\u2019s revival plan, father and son flew to Qatar to give presentations to Qatar Airways\\u2019 global chief executive Akbar Al Baker. They weren\\u2019t able to garner interest. It was a sorry end to a great entrepreneurship story.\\n\\nTAKE-OFF TO CRASH-LAND\\n\\nThe beginning of Goyal\\u2019s entrepreneurial journey \\u2014 from a cashier at his uncle Charandas Ramlal\\u2019s travel company East-West Agencies to an independent general sales agent (GSA) building connections with airline executives across the world \\u2014 has been told many times.\\n\\nGSAs in the 1990s were powerful. They worked as international airlines\\u2019 representatives in the local market and were several notches higher in the pecking order than travel agents.\\n\\nAt its peak, Jet Air Transport\\u2019s office was aligned with 17 desks, each representing a different global airline.\\n\\nAlways a sharp networker, Goyal once took a visiting official from lobbying body International Air Transport Association (IATA) to Agra, and bought him and his team marble-topped furniture worth?5 lakh. Then, over lunch and subsequent cups of tea, he had a threehour discussion on buying some smaller aircraft. This was a strategy meeting minus corporate frills.\\n\\nJet started as an air taxi service operator in 1993 and went on to become India\\u2019s biggest airline, offering top-class international services. It started with a 20% equity partnership with Kuwait Airways and Gulf Air, both of whom exited later. Its overseas operations kicked off with a Chennai-Colombo route in 2004. Its successful initial public offer (IPO) was in 2005. Nothing was going wrong. But then, something big did.\\n\\nTWO MISTAKES\\n\\nMany observers argue that Jet\\u2019s financial problems started with Goyal buying out rival Air Sahara in 2007 for Rs 1,450 crore, This was a deal that gave Jet endless problems \\u2013 financial, legal and human resource-related.\\n\\nGoyal bought Sahara to take on Kingfisher Airlines and low-fare carriers Air Deccan, IndiGo and SpiceJet. But the deal reduced Jet\\u2019s ability to spend extra money to take on the competition effectively. Jet wasted IPO funds that remained after placing plane orders.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter that, the smallest of bumps affected Jet more than its peers.\\n\\nOver the years, it has depended more and more on external positive factors such as fares going up and fuel prices coming down,\\u201d another industry executive pointed out.\\n\\nKingfisher shut down operations in 2012. IndiGo quietly grew to topple Jet from its leadership position. Then came the second big mistake.\\n\\nGoyal decided to buy a mixed fleet of 10 wide-bodied Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 planes. Mixing in such a small fleet was impractical as it increased cost of resources. Also, Goyal decided to configure them \\u201clike palaces,\\u201d building in only 308 seats, much lower than the global standard of about 400. He lost a fourth of the potential revenue in the process, executives said.\\n\\nEven when the configuration changed to 348 seats, Goyal insisted on retaining eight first class seats long after it was proven that they were not earning anything. He didn\\u2019t listen to advice from his then commerce chief Sudheer Raghavan and longtime associate, CEO Nikos Kardassis. At 250 kg each, the seats added an unnecessary 8 tonne to aircraft weight that earned nothing for the flight. What\\u2019s more, there was never a proper network planned for the aircraft.\\n\\nSince 2008, Jet had to lease out up to 70% of its wide-bodies to the likes of Turkish Airlines, Oman Air, Thai Airways, Gulf Air and Etihad. \\u201cJet wasn\\u2019t a leasing company, but was forced to behave like one,\\u201d said one of the people cited above. \\u201cAt least two executives from the top management used to travel for weeks every month in search of airlines that would take the aircraft on lease. It took up to six months to find an interested lessee. This, when fuel prices were rising, competition was getting brutal and the management should have focused on running the airline.\\u201d\\n\\nAUSSIE FROM ABU DHABI\\n\\nJet faced its first serious financial distress in 2011-12. Goyal responded by pretty much single-handedly leading negotiations with Etihad, run by hardnosed Australian James Hogan. Close to 50 meetings later, Goyal managed to sell Etihad 24% for $379 million, a nearimpossible price given the precarious state Jet was in. But the miracle came at a price \\u2014 Goyal soon saw his beloved company slipping out of his hands.\\n\\n\\u201cEtihad\\u2019s entry was the first instance that filled him with fear of losing control,\\u201d recalls an executive. The Gulf carrier came in with 15 men and an aim to \\u2018professionalise\\u2019 Jet, though also to make a feeder airline of it. Weekly meetings with department heads were organised, routes changed, branding overhauled and cost discrepancies flagged.\\n\\nBut Goyal soon took back charge. The Etihad men left. Almost as a retaliatory move, Jet shifted its global hub to Amsterdam, from Brussels, and in November 2017, signed deep commercial agreements with the Air France-KLM combine. This was an opportunity Goyal had squandered in 2010 by wooing Star Alliance, a global airline group that chose Air India as its member instead.\\n\\nAgain, Goyal stitched together the new agreement almost single-handedly, with trusted lieutenant Gaurang Shetty. That was perhaps his last big win for Jet, the ultimate proof of his superlative networking skills.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the fear of losing control had taken deep root. \\u201cIn many meetings last year, when he took the top management to task for the airline losing money, he often ended the tirades with, \\u2018What should I do? Dilute stake in the airline that I have built? Exit?\\u2019\\u201d recalled a former executive who was present at many of those meetings.\\n\\nMistakes piled up as Goyal started to run the airline again. In 2013-14, Jet had the opportunity to offload all the costly A330-200s to several potential buyers, including Turkish Airlines. But Goyal bargained over the price and lost the deal.\\n\\nAgain in 2016, Jet had the opportunity to sell its entire ATR fleet, which was incurring an annual loss of over $100 million, to Etihad Regional or Air Serbia. And again, Goyal baulked. These lost opportunities returned to haunt Jet. Over the last 12 months, it has searched for and failed to find buyers for its Airbus A330s and ATRs.\\n\\nFrom London last week, Goyal again bid for his airline after the lenders put it under the auctioneer\\u2019s hammer. His offer was rejected. In between, he continued to bicker with the lenders, saying they weren\\u2019t doing a proper job of reviving Jet. On multiple occasions in the past few months, potential investors Etihad and TPG threatened to walk out if Goyal remained at the airline. Ultimately, by the time the Goyals left Jet, it didn\\u2019t make a difference at all.\\n\\nNaresh Goyal, who built an airline from nothing, left behind a lesson for entrepreneurs \\u2014 no founder is bigger than the company he runs.\\n\\nMallya Sympathises with Goyals\\n\\nLONDON: Erstwhile liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya on Wednesday took to social media once again, this time to express his solidarity with Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal. \\u201cEven though Jet was a major competitor to Kingfisher at the time, I feel sorry to see such a large private airline on the brink of failure when government used Rs 35,000 crore of public funds to bail out Air India. Just being a PSU is no excuse for discrimination,\\u201d Mallya tweeted. \\u201cI have offered to pay back 100% but am being criminally charged instead. Airline Karma?\\u201d The UB Group chief expressed his sympathy for the troubles being faced by Goyal and his wife Neeta. \\u201cEven though we were fierce competitors, my sympathies go out to Naresh and Neeta Goyal, who built Jet Airways, that India should be extremely proud of. Fine airline providing vital connectivity and class service. Sad that so many airlines have bitten the dust in India. Why?\\u201d Mallya asked. - PTI\\n\\n- Source: https://bit.ly/2Zkp2On\\r\\n'"
